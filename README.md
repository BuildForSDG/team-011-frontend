# Farmlord

[![build status](https://github.com/coryrylan/angular-github-actions/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BuildForSDG/team-011-frontend/actions)

This application is an innovative solution for connecting subsistent farmers to land owners. It offers the farmers the opportunity to rent the lands or lease at affordable prices. We've built a solution that will help Farmers maximize their productivity and output every harvest by providing the most important resource every Farmer needs - Farmland Real Estate. Landowners that own Farmlands that laying unutilized benefits from this solution simply by enrolling on the platform and making their farmlands available in a virtual market. The whole process entails four simple steps

## Usage

The solution consist majorly of for steps

### 1. Farmlands

First, you will need to create an account on Farmlord either as Farmer or Landowner. As a Landowner, you can profile your pieces of farmlands on the platform which automatically becomes available on a virtual market. After registering as a Farmer, you may go on the virtual market and view land that interests you.

### 2. Requests

When you find an interesting Farmland that meets your need on the "farmland market", you will simply send a request with just one click! The Landowner will immediately get a "farmland request" notification on their dashboard, prompting them of a Farmer's interest on their listed property on the "farmland market"

### 3. Transact

As soon as a Landowner receives a request to rent or lease their farmland, they will review and accept the request if it meets their preference or decline accordingly. All of these processes should take a few minutes to complete a transaction end to end between a Landowner and the corresponding requesting Farmer.

### 4. Payment

After the Landowner has accepted the land request sent by a Farmer, the Farmer get a notification on their dashboard to make secure payment for a right occupy or lease the farmland as agreed in the terms between Farmer and the Land owner. We've made sure to integrated to a trusted and secure payment service.
